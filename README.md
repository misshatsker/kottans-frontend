# kottans-frontend

**Hey there!**

I am really excited about being part of kottans community. 

Although it's my first note here, I wanna thank you all in advance. I have been looking for different front-end courses/workshops for some time, but instead, I've found like-minded people, and I hope even friends. 

Albeit not everything is smooth in learning so far, I'm sure we are all bound to succeed!

I enjoyed the Git course on Udacity. Regarding `learngitbranching.js.org` I need more real-life practice.

I really appreciate all you've done and the enormous amount of you time you share with us. 

Thank you, front-end beasts!

## Linux CLI, and HTTP

1.  [Module 1](/task_linux_cli/module-1.jpg)

1. [Module 4](/task_linux_cli/module-4.jpg)

I became familiar with linux cli. Now I know how to find, create, edit and delete files using cli. The most thrilling part of that section was about granting permissions. It was completely new for me, and looks useful for data protection. At the end of the course I learned how to deal with processes. 

In secont part I was learning what HTTP is. What is the difference between HTTP and HTTPS. How does it work by and large. 
Although part 2 seemed to me a little bit overwhelming due to amount  of theoretical information, I liked those articles.

Supplementary I watched a video from KharkivJS ["A tale about one request"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXXdYCd93F8&ab_channel=KharkivJSCommunity), that helped me to realize how the global networking works step by step.
