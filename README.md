# kottans-frontend

**Hey there!**

I am really excited about being part of kottans community. 

Although it's my first note here, I wanna thank you all in advance. I have been looking for different front-end courses/workshops for some time, but instead, I've found like-minded people, and I hope even friends. 

Albeit not everything is smooth in learning so far, I'm sure we are all bound to succeed!

I enjoyed the Git course on Udacity. Regarding `learngitbranching.js.org` I need more real-life practice.

I really appreciate all you've done and the enormous amount of you time you share with us. 

Thank you, front-end beasts!
