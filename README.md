# kottans-frontend

**Hey there!**

I am really excited about being part of kottans community. 

Although it's my first note here, I wanna thank you all in advance. I have been looking for different front-end courses/workshops for some time, but instead, I've found like-minded people, and I hope even friends. 

Albeit not everything is smooth in learning so far, I'm sure we are all bound to succeed!

I enjoyed the Git course on Udacity. Regarding `learngitbranching.js.org` I need more real-life practice.

I really appreciate all you've done and the enormous amount of you time you share with us. 

Thank you, front-end beasts!

## Linux CLI, and HTTP

1.  [Module 1](/task_linux_cli/module-1.jpg)
1. [Module 2](/task_linux_cli/module-2.jpg)
1. [Module 3](/task_linux_cli/module-3.jpg)
1. [Module 4](/task_linux_cli/module-4.jpg)

I became familiar with linux cli. Now I know how to find, create, edit and delete files using cli. The most thrilling part of that section was about granting permissions. It was completely new for me, and looks useful for data protection. At the end of the course I learned how to deal with processes. 

In secont part I was learning what HTTP is. What is the difference between HTTP and HTTPS. How does it work by and large. 
Although part 2 seemed to me a little bit overwhelming due to amount  of theoretical information, I liked those articles.

Supplementary I watched a video from KharkivJS ["A tale about one request"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXXdYCd93F8&ab_channel=KharkivJSCommunity), that helped me to realize how the global networking works step by step. 

## Git Collaboration

As for me, gamification of the learning process is always a good idea. And such a course isn't an exception. I liked the way how lessons were designed. Now I have powerful tools for collaborative work and work using Version Control System in my toolbox. However, I guess some lessons had more theoretical value, I mean that there were cases when it was difficult to imagine what is the purpose to use all of the tools/commands in practice. Maybe I just need more practice.  

## Intro to HTML and CSS

1.  [Udacity Intro to HTML and CSS](/intro_to_HTML_and_CSS/udacity_html_css.jpg)
1. [codecademy Learn HTML, Learn CSS](/intro_to_HTML_and_CSS/css_html.jpg)

During learning that section I got fundamental knowledge in layouts building and styling using HTML and CSS accordingly. 

Despite it took more time than I expected, I've got a full picture of how to work with a variety of elements, including semantic ones, and how to build tables and forms. In the CSS course, I picked up how to apply styles to elements.

Excited to start diving into responsive Web Design.

## Responsive Web Design

1.  [Flexbox Froggy ](/responsive_web_design/frog.jpg)
1. [Grid Garden ](/responsive_web_design/garden.jpg)

I found lectures useful as far as it was unclear for me how to build responsive layout and what it actually means) 

I enjoyed flexbox tutorials (frogs seemed to be more friendly-oriented  than carrots for me), maybe I just need more practice.

## JS Basics
1.  [Coursera ](/js_basics/coursera.jpg)
1. [Basic JS ](/js_basics/jsbasics.jpg)
1.  [ES6 ](/js_basics/es6.jpg)
1. [Basic Data Structures ](/js_basics/datastructure.jpg)
1.  [Basic Algorithm Scripting ](/js_basics/basicalgorithm.jpg)
1. [Functional Programming ](/js_basics/functional.jpg)
1. [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting ](/js_basics/intermediaalgorithm.jpg)

This was the most challenging module for me so far. It a challenging from a variety of perspectives. It took me more time than I'd expected even for some basic modules. And the volume of new information sometimes overwhelmed me. But I hope it's just a matter of time to become a master. 

## DOM
1.  [Demo](https://misshatsker.github.io/document-object-model/)
1.  [Coursera](/task_js_dom/coursera.jpg)
1. [freecodecamp Algorithm Scripting Challenges](/task_js_dom/12-18.jpg)

I've accomplished a task related to DOM. The result of it seemed to have more meaningful value, which could be considered as a tiny part of some web-site. Also, I've completed 2nd part of the algorithms topic, despite I've stuck for a while on a task based on math.
By and large, DOM seems more clear from a usage perspective in web development. Also, I'm going to learn materials from an additional section to have a better understanding.

## Building a Tiny JS World

## Object Oriented JS

2. [Demo](https://misshatsker.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/)
3. [Code base](https://github.com/misshatsker/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game)

A lot of new information for me again. Programming never ceases to amaze me. I never in my life thought that one day I would be able to implement a game. It is very cool, although difficult.

## OOP Exercis

## Offline Web Applications

1.  [Udacity Offline Web Applications](/task-offline-web-app/udacity.jpg)

I have never wondered how information is displayed when there is no access to the Internet. So this section was somewhat magical for me. This course covers all the important cases I can meet when I will be a programmer, but I cannot say that I have learned 100% of the information at this stage. I got acquainted. I now know that such a thing exists.
